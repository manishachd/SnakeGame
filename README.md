# SNAKE GAME

This is a recreation of the classic snake game where the user controls a snake using up, down, left, and right arrows in an attempt to collect apples and grow longer.
If the snake collides with the walls or itself then the game is over and the score is recorded. The goal is to collect the most apples and score the highest score.

Clone the repository and run snake_game.py to play.
